            Customer testimonials and increased customer engagement may help with the uncertainty around shipping, as long as client can actually maintain a good reputation around shipping than good ratings would ease new client's anxieties. Maybe a "Customer of the week" blog post of customers posting a picture of their recently purchased item and their entire experience.
